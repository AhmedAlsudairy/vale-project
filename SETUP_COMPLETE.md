# Quick Cloudinary Setup

## You're almost ready! Here's what's configured:

✅ **Database Connection**: Fixed and working
✅ **Next.js Development Server**: Running on http://localhost:3000
✅ **Environment Variables**: Cloudinary credentials are set

## Final Step - Create Cloudinary Upload Preset:

Since I can see your Cloudinary credentials are already in the `.env` file, you just need to create the upload preset:

### Quick Steps:
1. Go to: https://console.cloudinary.com/console/c-djx4ybbtb/settings/upload
2. Click "Upload presets" tab
3. Click "Add upload preset"
4. Set these values:
   - **Preset name**: `lrs_thermography`
   - **Upload mode**: `Unsigned`
   - **Folder**: `lrs-thermography`
   - **Max file size**: `5000000` (5MB)
   - **Allowed formats**: `jpg,png,jpeg,webp`

5. Click "Save"

### Test the System:
1. Go to: http://localhost:3000/lrs-thermography
2. Click "New LRS Session"
3. Fill in the form and try uploading images
4. You should be able to upload multiple images, set preview images, and remove images

## Features Now Available:
